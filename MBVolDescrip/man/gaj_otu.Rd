\description{
Gajer et al. (2012) sampled the vaginal microbiome of 32 healthy women
twice-weekly for 16 weeks, sequencing the V1-V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene.
Participants reported menstrual bleeding, sexual activity, medications and
contraceptives, and other characteristics in daily diaries. OTU counts were
computed based on the original studyâ€™s reported OTU proportions and total
read counts, rounded to the nearest whole number.
