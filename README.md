# Describing Microbiome Volatility 

This project aims to describe how measures of microbiome volatility depend on factors such as density of sampling (and relatedly, balanced or unbalanced data) and rarefaction using four publicly available microbiome time series datasets: 

1. Moving Pictures, Caporaso et al. (2011) 
    - gut microbiome 
    - 2 subjects
    - 131 and 336 daily samples 
2. Student Microbiome Project, Flores et al. (2014) 
    - gut microbiome
    - 58 subjects 
    - weekly samples over the course of 3 months; 7-10 time samples per subject
3. Healthy vaginal microbiome, Gajer et al. (2012) 
    - vaginal microbiome 
    - 32 subjects 
    - 25-33 samples per subject, twice-weekly 
4. Pre-bacterial vaginosis microbiome, Ravel et al. (2013) 
    - vaginal microbiome 
    - 6 subjects (with at least 20 daily samples prior to BV diagnosis) 
    - 23-38 daily samples
